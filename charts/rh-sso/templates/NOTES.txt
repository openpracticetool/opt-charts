A new persistent RH-SSO service (using PostgreSQL) has been created in your
  project. The admin username/password for accessing the master realm via the
  RH-SSO console is {{ .Values.admin.user }}/{{ .Values.admin.pass }}. The
  username/password for accessing the PostgreSQL database "{{ .Values.database.name }}" is
  {{ .Values.database.user }}/{{ .Values.database.pass }}. The HTTPS keystore used for serving secure
  content, the JGroups keystore used for securing JGroups communications, and
  server truststore used for securing RH-SSO requests were automatically created
  via OpenShift's service serving x509 certificate secrets.
